        <h1> A new style </h1>

        <p>
            My goal today was to change the Taskboard so that it had some new buttons.  
            Unfortunately I didn't get to that.  
            I did however review how cascading style sheets <i>cascade</i>.  
            This process took longer than I'd like to admit but that does not mean it was without worth.  

        </p>

        <p>
            For my own sake I'll summarize what I went over today.  
            

        </p> 

        <p>
            <h3> What is the Cascade?</h3>
            The word cascade refers to the process which determines the properties of elements in an html file.  
            Occasionally these properties come into conflict.  This only occurs when two properties have equal specificity.  
            <h3> What is specificity in the context of the cascading style sheet? </h3>
            Specificity is the calculated weight of a given property.  
            Web-dev textbooks might define specificity as fallows:
            <p>
            <i>"Specificity is the process that the browser uses to decide which rule applies if there are multiple rules with different selectors".</i>
            </p>
            I am not a fan of this definition.
            The weight assigned to a propertie's specificity is determined by the types of selectors in that property.  
            <h3> What are selectors in the context of the cascading style sheet? </h3>
            Selectors are key words that reference tags or attributes of an element in an html file.
            <h3> How does the browser resolve conflict between element properties? </h3>
            The browser resolves CSS conflicts by assessing three peices of information
            <ul>
                <li>Source Order</li>
                <li>Specificity</li>
                <li>Importance</li>
            </ul>
            Source order refers to the properties position on the cascading style sheet.  
            Properties that come later are given priority.  

            Clearly two properties cannot exist in the same position on the style sheet so the next criteria to be assessed is specificity.  
            The table bellow gives the associated weights for some CSS selectors.  
            <p></p>
            <style>
                table, th, td 
                {
                    border: 1px solid black;
                }
            </style>
            <table >
                <tr>
                    <th> Selector </th>
                    <th> Example </th>
                    <th> Weight </th>
                </tr>
                <tr> 
                    <th> Inline Styles </th>
                    <th> Style="background-color: black;"</th>
                    <th> 1000 </th>
                </tr>
                <tr> 
                    <th> ID Selectors </th>
                    <th> id="outer"</th>
                    <th> 100 </th>
                </tr>
                <tr> 
                    <th> Class Selectors </th>
                    <th> class = "bright"</th>
                    <th> 10 </th>
                </tr>
                <tr> 
                    <th> Element Selectors </th>
                    <th> div </th>
                    <th> 1 </th>
                </tr>
            </table>
            A nested paragraph on an html page would probably have a specifity that might look like...  
            <b>html > body > div.grid-container > div.item4 > div.blog > div > div.filterDiv.show.css > article.l > table > tbody ... </b>
            This would have a very high specificity.  Not that you'd ever define a property like that... right?  

            <p>
                Lastly there is something called <i>"Importance"</i> which is should never be abused.  
                Yes, any css property will accept the <b>!Important</b> argument.  
                This trumps all.  
                It will also make debugging your CSS far more difficult than usual.
            </p>

                Hopefully I can make use of this in proper soon.  That To-Do never seems to shrink.
