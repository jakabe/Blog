		<h1> Wednesday Night Coding Goals</h1>
		<p>
			So I needed more time to complete the makePost.java app.  
			This was due to several factors.  
			<ul>
				<li>Sudden change in work schedule
					<ul>
						<li>Allocating time to study for certifications</li>
						<li>Resume and Cover reformating</li>
						<li>Interview question cramming</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Home and Errands</li>
				<li>Miscellaneous Distractions throughout the day</li>
				<li>Regular Working Hours</li>
			</ul>

			Five days behind schedule isn't that bad considering how badly I've procrastinated projects in the past.  
			Moving forward I'll just need to keep track of these things... Maybe score them somehow?
		</p>

		<p>
			This evening I'll be starting on "Quiz-app.js".  
			I already have the layout planned.  
			Now I just need to churn it out as a functional piece.
