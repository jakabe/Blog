			So I finally sat down this afternoon and started churning out the app that now helps me speed up blog posts.  
			I started around 2pm and casually walked through reminding myself how java code looks and feels.  
			The extensions that visual studio code has for java are really great.  
			My favorite is sonarlint.  It caught me reusing a string of text in multiple places and suggested I just make a constant.  
			I really appreciate that touch.  This project probably took me three hours of consistent effort.
