            So I took an extra day to add some buttons to the <a href="https://jakabe.github.io/TaskBoard/">TB</a>.  
            I'm really happy with how it's developing.  The fact that I can use it while working on it also brightens my day.  
            I'll start on the javascript for the priority buttons today.  I want to have this finished by friday.

            Modifying the CSS took a lot longer than expected.  Either I'm not understanding something fundamental or I need better tools.  
            Speaking of tools there is something that I'd like to add to the TB.  
            A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Timer</a>.
