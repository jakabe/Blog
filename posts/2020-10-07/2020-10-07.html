        <p>
            I spent some time today on the site style file.  I have found that Chromes developer tools are very handy!
            You can actually tweak CSS content live to see what the changes look like.  
            However I've only gotten this far by installing a local server with XAMP.  
            
        </p>

        
        <p> 
            XAMP is not very cooperative with windows and I simply don't have the know how at this time to circumvent it so whenever XAMP is shut down it throws a tantrum and a lot of error windows pop up.
            I'm looking forward to getting js working properly now that I have a better working environment for it.
