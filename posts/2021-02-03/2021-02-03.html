				It's been a while.  Oh boy, has it been an interesting few months.  Incase any future historians stumble accross this,  I'll give some context.  
				There is still a global pandemic raging on.  One of the global military superpowers bit the dust by electing a wannabe-dictator.  
				Rich people's yacht money (The Economy) has seen better days. Last week a group mind from reddit attacked Wall St. by short squeezing a hedge fund of 19 billion dollars.
				That was pretty cool.  As for myself?  I spent the holidays just relaxing.  December and January happened so quickly.  I've just been working and listening to audio books.  
				For a few days I obsessively sketched hands.  I became pretty good at it to!

				I haven't looked at the Task Board since November.  It looks like there is definitely some stuff that needs to be moved, updated or altogether removed.

				so lets think about those changes.  I can remove the 'Update Blog site' as that will be an endless to-do.  
				I think I need to set aside the idea ofa 'Blog posting API' for now.  So we can trash that.
				The pomodoro was a cute idea but I put zero effort into it after it went on the list so that can go.  
				I'll toss the batch file idea for XAMP, Github and VS code.  The work related stuff can go, I completed those tasks.  
				The 'Update Blog Site To Do's list can go as well.

				Alright, cleaned that up.  I added some features I'd like to see.  Some will be easy, others not so much.

				In the mean time I've been tinkering with python and matplot.  With the recent volitility in the stock market I wanted to write some calculator apps.  I've got to say, python is so simple that its scary.

				Also here is an RSS feed!
