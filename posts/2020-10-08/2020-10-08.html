        <h1>Time to update the Task Board</h1>
            
        <p>
            Task Board has been updated to reflect new MicroBlog CSS and Blog Filter js.  
            I think I'll spend some time working on the board itself.  Those tasks have been getting pretty stale.
            I'll prioritize the priority indicator for each task.  
            
        </p>

            I haven't figured out how to get p5.js to run in instantiation mode yet.
            The problem grew to quickly so I set that down on 5/8 after fiddling with it all day.
            Although I found some useful videos on it, none of their proposed solutions would work.
            Now that I've got XAMP running, I hope that the browser will be able to locate and execute the javascript and make use of the p5.js library locally.
            I'm not sure why my intuition is telling me that the browser can't access non-local libraries that are referenced in a separate html file.

        <h2>"Problems"</h2>
        <p> 
            I'm beginning to notice how I work problems.
            When I get stuck on one, I keep a collection of other problems on the back burner so I can do some productive procrastination.
            Maybe it's because I get board easily?  But if that were true then why am I so obsessive over problem solving...
            <i>So much to consider...</i>
