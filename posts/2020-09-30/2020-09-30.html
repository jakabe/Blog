        Today I updated the blog's style.css so that it remains presentable under a responsive layout.  It didn't look very pretty on mobile.  Now it should scale properly.  
        I'd like to get the AJAX call working so that I can keep posts separate from the index.html and just load them in as necessary.  The problem that I have encountered with trying to grab an html file from a local directory is that I get an error "ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND" among other things.

        If you didn't already know, google has special search <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433">operators</a>.  After a few searches with queries like 
        <ul>
          <li><i>site:stackoverflow.com include error COR policy html</i></li>
          <li><i>site:stackoverflow.com from origin null</i></li>
        </ul>
        I found a solution for a similar problem <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25923796/cors-error-with-jquery">here</a>.  
        Unfortunately finding my local chrome.exe was more difficult than originally thought since I have a few too many hard drives.  It's a weird problem I know. 
        Anyway I implemented <a href="https://www.shipmethis.com/2017/08/-allow-file-access-from-files-Chrome.html">this</a> solution and got things running locally.

    It's taken a few years but I've learned that if you take things slowly your efforts pay out in <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/pay+dividends">dividends</a>.
    I'll be using the classic <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_dropdowns.asp">w3schools</a> template until I can fabri-cobble something fancier for the archive menu to the left.
