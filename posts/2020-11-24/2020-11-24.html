			Inverse Kinematics and motion...
		</h1>

		<p>
			So I've been learning more about inverse kinematics recently.  
			I started by watching Daniel Shiffman's code challenge videos and working along with him.  
			I then found this excellent playlist on youtube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLXoDRctwRg&list=PLT_0lwItn0sDBE98BsbaZezflB96ws12b&ab_channel=AngelaSodemann"> Angela Sodemann</a>.  
			This has inspired me to put together my own matrix class in javascript.  
			Below you can see a snip of some latex I put together today.
