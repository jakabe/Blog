			Sometimes life gets messy.  
			I think I will dedicate December to code review.  
			I'm certain that there is a lot to clean up in the Blog repo alone.  
			I've been taking it easy for the last week or so. 
			Working nights is pretty draining.

			I've been piecing <a href="https://jakabe.github.io/Blog/SidePages/politico/">something</a> together as an experiment in graphing information.  
			Firstly it's been an exercise in adding features on the fly.  
			Secondly it's been interesting working with open source libraries.  
			I've been using <a href="https://github.com/diwi/p5.EasyCam">this</a> library for 3D stuff.

			I would like to start tinkering with physics a bit <a href="https://jakabe.github.io/Blog/SidePages/inversekinematics-1/">more</a>.
