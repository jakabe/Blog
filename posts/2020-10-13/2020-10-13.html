           So I made a <a href="https://jakabe.github.io/GnomeGenerator/">Gnome Generator</a>.  
           In theory it's really straight forward.  It just draws some basic shapes and randomly colors them.  
           The names are generated by randomly selecting prefixes, first names, suffixes, last names and titles.  
           Each of these catagories exists as an array.

            Tomorrow I'm going to do some work on the Task Board.
              Ideally I'd like to have the priority functionality <i>appear</i> to be in place.
              This means adding triangle divs to the screen or possibly loading a pair of PNG's.
              I am envisioning something like <b>onclick -> increasePriorityFn()</b>.  
              The increasePriorityFn() will use the list tags to get the appropriate element from the <b>BOARD</b> array.
              For it to be said that an item has "increased" in priority it must swap places with the item above it.
              So that's what I'll probably end up doing.
