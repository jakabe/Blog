        <h1>Happy Thanksgiving!</h1>
            
       <p>
           Happy Thanksgiving!  This weekend went better than expected.  None of my projects were worked on but we all need time to wind down.
             This week I'll get back to adding features to the Taskboard.  
             I want to put together a side project.  I call it "<i>Gnome Generator</i>". 
             I also want to finally figure out how to present p5.js canvases inside of posts.
