        <h1> Short and long term goals </h1>
        <p>
           Personally I think it's important to write out your own goals.  
           Ideally they should be <b>S.M.A.R.T.</b>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square; position: relative; left: 0px;">
            <li><b>S</b>pecific</li>
            <li><b>M</b>easurable</li>
            <li><b>A</b>ttainable</li>
            <li><b>R</b>ealistic</li>
            <li><b>T</b>ime bound</li>
        </ul> 
                <p>
                    Even if you can't achieve each of the SMART goal criteria, your goals should never be <b>V.A.P.I.D.</b> 
                </p>
        <ui style="list-style-type:square; position: relative; left: 20px;">
            <li><b>V</b>ague</li>
            <li><b>A</b>morphous</li>
            <li><b>P</b>ie in the sky</li>
            <li><b>I</b>rrelevant</li>
            <li><b>D</b>elayed</li> 
        </ui>
        <p> </p>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;;"> Post-app.java </h3>
        <p style="padding-top: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
            As I mentioned before I'd like to make blog posting faster.  
            The Post-app will have a few requirements to be considered done.  
            We call this the defintion of done (DOD). 

            <ul>
                <li>UI
                    <ul>
                        <li>accept directory for folder/files</li>
                        <li>accepts date as folder name</li>
                        <li>accepts blog or microblog as arguments</li>
                        <li>provides directory contents of folder</li>
                        <li>prompt user to review changes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Functions
                    <ul>
                        <li>parse keyboard input for correct formatting</li>
                        <li>check if dated folder exists</li>
                        <li>check if dated html file exits (blog or microblog)</li>
                        <li>create new folder for indicated date</li>
                        <li>create new html file for indicated date</li>
                        <li>populate html file with boilerplate html code</li>
                        <li>correctly adjust date of html post with date provided by user input</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            I think I can complete this ( with unit tests ) in a single day.  
            So Monday November 2<sup>nd</sup> I will begin creating this tool.  
            When I finish it I'll create a github repo and post it there.  
            This way I will know how much time it actually took.  
            By measuring the time of this task I will have a better idea of how quickly I can start churning out these tools.

        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;;"> Quiz-app.js </h3>
        <p style="padding-top: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
            Back in university I spent a few months putting together a quiz generating app in java.  
            It was cumbersome and overly complicated but really helped improve my coding skills.  
            I'd like to remake it in javascript so I can access it in the browser.  
            <ul>
                <li>UI
                    <ul>
                        <li>prompt user for name of subject</li>
                        <li>prompt user for question</li>
                        <li>prompt user for answer</li>
                        <li>produce multiple choice quiz from question/answer array</li>
                        <li><b>K.I.S.S.</b> ( Keep It Stupid Simple -> visuals )</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Functions
                    <ul>
                        <li>name array after subject from user input as subject-questions</li>
                        <li>name array after subject from user input as subject-answers</li>
                        <li>insert question into question array</li>
                        <li>insert answer into answer array</li>
                        <li>save both to local files</li>
                        <li>generate quiz array structure for display</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            This needs to be done quickly, and does not have to look good (yet?).  
            I think I can get this done in a day or two.  
            I will start this tomorrow after studying.  
        </p>
