			Change... Part 1

			“Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
		I need to get myself away from this place
		I said yep, what a concept
		I could use a little fuel myself
		And we could all use a little change
		Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
		Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running”

			When I was younger I used to get upset and throw myself at a problem.  I’d start off in a crouch, lunge forward, and sprint full speed towards whatever I needed to change.  This was foolhardy and left me exhausted.  Occasionally it was the right method to solve a given life problem but it was far from ideal.  I am a few years older now and I’ve been attending to my new problems in a slow and methodical manner.  This also has its downsides.  For instance it makes me rigid and inflexible when I need to adapt to a dynamic situation.  When I would throw myself into the problem and immerse myself in solving it there was never time for the situation to change on its own.

		<p>
			I realize that a lot of life’s situations are governed by the desires, intents and wishes of people nearby.  The problems that I am used to become dynamic as a consequence of human nature, and not prevailing natural forces.  Complexity is built in not by underlying unseen attractors but overtly addressable agents.  Those same agents are constrained by the same parameters you or I have. They need basic fundamental needs met such as sleep, nutrition, shelter and safety.  They have changing cognitions which give rise to more complex needs that depend on their current goals, objectives and purposes.  

		</p>
		
		<p>
			Rather than emerging from complexity, all of these traits are dependent on simpler properties.  Without sleep an individual cannot function at their usual capacity.  Without shelter or safety they have to expend extra time and resources to perform basic self maintenance.  Without proper nutrition a human being’s body and mind begin to deteriorate and they incur a longer lasting deficit that detracts from all of their abilities.  Energy is the great equalizer.  

		</p>
		
		<p>
			For a given problem with static traits and factors a slow and methodical problem solving approach has been ideal for myself.  When in school I worked on a lot of math or computer science problems.  The problems themselves were inscribed on paper and unchanging.  In life the great balancing act is dependent on the only universal constant and that is change.  From the subatomic to the cosmic scale everything is in motion.  To call something a concrete problem is a misnomer unless we are actually talking about concrete.  Real problems have more heads than the hydra.

			The 1944 play ‘No exit’ by Jean-Paul Sartre has memorialized the phrase “Hell is other people”.  In reality people are just a collection of perceptions, behaviors, ideals and traits held by the observer.  The Hell of their existence is drawn from the observer’s need to conserve energy and generalize the attributes of others into compressed and easily digested forms.  To truly know someone and to love them is an exhaustive experience into the soul of humanity.   

		</p>
		
		<p>
			In true form to the human condition one might even express the chance to succeed as a function of power.  Where power is the expression of energy over a given time interval it is clear that as one expends more energy to solve a given problem over a shorter interval of time the likelihood of their success increases.  As a young man it appears I sought this method out instinctively-as any person might.  I should think that I had taken for granted such an effect tool.
