        <h1> Algorithm Analysis:  <i>"Just take the highest power..."</i> </h1>
        <p>
            When I was first introduced to <i>Big-O</i> notation I was given the explanation that it simply meant you "rounded" the expression.  

            Lets look at some real world examples and then some code.
        </p>

        <h3> Example: "Time to buy a watch"</h3>
        
        <p>
            Let us say that I don't know what time of day it is but I know my friend is wearing a watch.  
        In order to get the time I simply ask my friend what time it is.  
        My friend isn't particularly funny so he tells me the time and the scenario is resolved.  
        This took a constant number of operations to resolve a solution so we say it had O(1) complexity.
        </p>

        <h3> Example: "Handing out tests" </h3>
        <p> 
            In university I was a paid lab assistant so I had to hand out midterms and then grade them.  
            For this example let us say that on the day that students are scheduled to write their midterm I am to place one midterm test on each occupied desk.  
            In order to complete this task I will need to go to each of n occupied desks and place one midterm on them.  
            This will take a variable number of operations as not all desks are occupied.  Thus we say this has O(n) complexity.  
        </p>

        <h3> Example: "Server Chassis is locked"</h3>
        <p>
            At work there is a server chassis that has a key... somewhere.  
            There are a number of lock boxes containing unique keys in the facility.  
            Sometimes keys are mistakenly swapped by staff.
            One of them has the server chassis key.  
            So if I need to open the chassis I need to go to each key box and search it for the key I need.  
            So for n keys with n boxes to search, I will have to perform at worst n<sup>2</sup> operations.  
            We say that this has O(n<sup>2</sup>) complexity.  
        </p>

        <h3> Example: Adding names from a string to a list</h3>
        <p>
            In my post <i><a style = "color: cyan" href="#2020-10-20"       >String Manipulation and Gnomes</a></i> I said I'd return to that particular function. Let's do that now.
        </p>
        <div class = "cb">
            
            <br>function addToFirstNameList(n1)
            <br>{
            <br> <div class="cb tb">var nl = n1.length;</div>
            <br> <div class="cb tb">...</div>
            <!-- <br> <div class="cb tb">for( var i = 0 ; i < nl ; i++){...}</div> -->
            <br> <div class="cb tb"></div>
            }
            <p>//fin</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Here we can see that the nl variable has been initialized <u>AND</u> assigned a value.  
            This function only requires two steps so far.  At this point we may say that it has O(1). 
        </p>

        <div class = "cb">
            
            <br>function addToFirstNameList(n1)
            <br>{
            <br> <div class="cb tb">var nl = n1.length;  // O(1) with two operations</div> 
            <br> <div class="cb tb">for( var i = 0 ; i < nl ; i++){...}</div>
            <!-- <br> <div class="cb tb"></div> -->
            <br> <div class="cb tb"></div>}
            <p>//fin</p>
        </div>
        
        
        <p>
            Now that we have the for loop we can see that there are a number of operations that will occur only once followed by some operations that will repeat.  
            All for loops require a variable to act as a sort of index.  
            In this case we have initialized i and assigned it a value.  
            That is two more operations.  
            For every recurrence of the loop we will check the value of i against nl.  
            So long as i is less than nl in this loop we increment it by 1.  
            So far we have added four operations that will occur once and two operations for every time i is less than nl.  
            We may express this as <b>f(n)=4+2n</b>.
        </p>

        <div class = "cb">
            
            <br>function addToFirstNameList(n1)
            <br>{
            <br> <div class="cb tb">var nl = n1.length;  // O(1) with two operations</div> 
            <br> <div class="cb tb">for( var i = 0 ; i < nl ; i++) // O(1) followed by O(n)</div>
            <br> <div class="cb tb">{</div>
                
                <br> <div class="cb tb" style=" padding-left: 60px; ">var tempName = n1.slice(0,n1.indexOf(','));</div>
                <br> <div class="cb tb" style=" padding-left: 60px; ">n1 = n1.replace(tempName+', ', "");</div>
                <!-- <br> <div class="cb tb" style=" padding-left: 60px; ">if(n1 == tempName || n1 == "" )</div>
                <br> <div class="cb tb" style=" padding-left: 60px; ">{</div>
                <br> <div class="cb tb" style=" padding-left: 80px; "> break;</div>
                <br> <div class="cb tb" style=" padding-left: 60px; ">}</div> -->
                <br> <div class="cb tb" style=" padding-left: 60px; ">...</div>
                <br> <div class="cb tb" style=" padding-left: 60px; ">first_Name_Array.push(tempName);</div>
                
                <br> <div class="cb tb">}</div>
            <br> <div class="cb tb"></div>}
            <p>//fin</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            I'll be honest, I'm not sure how many operations go into initializing and assigning value to tempName, but if I had to guess it looks something like 4 pluse maybe all the checks it has to do to find the index of ',' .
            We are going to need more variables.  
            We already know that the string n1 is nl characters long so we can keep that for descriptive purposes.  
            In the case that there is only one comma and it is at the end of the n1 string we may conclude that there would be nl operations occuring.  
            So lets say that this line alone has O(n) complexity where n is nl.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next line down performs a similar operation so we may say that it is also O(n) where n will be the number of occurences of the substring tempName + ', ' .
            The final line we see a push operation occuring so it only happens once for each loop. 

        </p>

            Here we see a lowly if statement chisling out a meager existence.   
            It performs two operations in the argument and a third in the clause.  
            These all occur some n times so we can say that this too has O(n) complexity.
        </p>
       
        <div class = "cb">
            
            <br>function addToFirstNameList(n1)
            <br>{
            <br> <div class="cb tb">var nl = n1.length;  // O(1) with two operations</div> 
            <br> <div class="cb tb">for( var i = 0 ; i < nl ; i++) // O(1) followed by O(n)</div>

            <p>//fin</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            From this analysis we can conclude that this function has O(n)*O(n) = O(n<sup>2</sup>) complexity.  
            I think I'll continue this topic in a future post where I talk about the actual definition of Big-O notation.
