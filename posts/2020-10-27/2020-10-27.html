        <h1> Making Posts Easier and Other Project Improvements </h1>
        <p>
           My month long journey of self-taught web development has certainly been interesting.  
           I really enjoy writing most days, even it's something small.  
           Having an excess of thoughts doesn't lend itself to the most efficient of thought processes.  
           Writing really helps put together those ideas into useful tools and tennable forms.

            To make my blog posts just that much easier to continue I will need to modify my process.  
            My idea is to make a simple java app that will make a folder in the post directory with the current date and then populate that folder with html files.  
            Once it has done that it will modify the index.html file to include the posts when the page is loaded, as well as add an archive link.  
            Speaking of the archive drop down menu.  I will need to rebuild it so that the lists are nested in order of years and months.
