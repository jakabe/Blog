    <h1>Post Tags and MicroBlog Styling</h1>

    <p>
        As I mentioned last week I would like to set up a post filtering system for this blog.  
        I think I'd like to have a separate drop down menu beneath the Archives menu. 
        The drop down menu will probably have some key words in alphabetical(?) order.
        Whether I'll adjust the posting html template or the index.html is yet to be seen.
    </p>

        I'd also like to write the CSS for the MicroBlog posts today.  
        Maybe I'll just skew their palletes to make them visually distint.
        Make them more narrow? Hmmm....
