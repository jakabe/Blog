        <h1>Two Steps Forward...</h1>
            
        <p>  
            Yesterday I tweaked the CSS code for the Task Board.
              The lists are a bit prettier but they aren't perfect.
              They are nice for right now. I used the chrome DevTools to modify a lot of the CSS code.
              It's much faster than opening up the style.css file in VS-code, modifying the properties of an element, saving, and refreshing the browser.

           Updating the javascript took most of my time.
             The functions that 'draw' elements on the screen needed to know how to add a style property inline.
             To do this I gave every new list added to the screen the tag style="top: 160; left: 0". 
             In order to modify that attribute I use the elements listIndex tag to find its position in an array.
             Each element in the <b>BOARD</b> array contains an object.  These are the lists you see drawn on the screen.
             When you click and drag a list on the screen the document waits for you to release the mouse.  
             Once it sees the mouse is no longer depressed it sets the objects's top and left properties to the new coordinates on the screen.
             This way, when you refresh the page or come back to it the lists will be drawn in the same place.

        <h2>Relative Lengths</h2>
        <p>
            Oh man did I goof up.  I started using relative lengths for the lists instead of absolute lengths
            Originally the lists on the page were measured in pixels but I found that using relative lengths made them look more proportionate in a few test cases.
            Unfortunately I didn't think to zoom in and out of the window, or adjust the browser for mobile viewing.
            The result is sort of silly looking.

            As much as I enjoy the font style I think I'll have to use something else due to sizing.  
            Even when I modify the font attributes of the google-font that I'm using, the font doesn't want to change size or position.
            This is leading to some strange text overflow.
